                        The Apple-designed 
                        H2 chip is the force behind the advanced audio performance of AirPods Pro, 
                        working with the driver and amplifier to create crisp, high-definition sound.  
                        It uses computational algorithms to deliver noise cancellation,<span style="color: green;">superior three-dimensional sound, 
                        and efficient battery life — all at once.</span> 
        
                        The chip uses powerful adaptation algorithms to process sound more quickly, 
                        tuning audio at the precise moment you hear it. Every detail is rendered for your specific ear
                        shape, immersing you in higher-fidelity sound.
                        An inward-facing microphone works with voice enhancement algorithms
                        to recognize and articulate your voice, so your phone and video calls
                        always sound completely natural.
                        X-ray perspective of AirPods Pro with casing of H2 chip highlighted.
                        A custom-built driver and amplifier work with the H2 chip to provide lower d
                        istortion during playback, so you'll hear deeper bass and crisper highs — across all volume
                        levels.
                        <span style="color: green;">The H2-powered AirPods Pro</span> now feature Adaptive Audio,
                        automatically prioritizing sounds that need your attention as
                        you move through the world. By seamlessly blending Active Noise Cancellation
                        with Transparency mode when you need it, Adaptive Audio magically delivers the 
                        right mix of sound for any environment.
